This is a raspberry pi project to build an open source robotic companion. 
It will be pulling together resources and repositories from other projects to allow voice recognition, 
actions via GPIO board and information retrieval from online sources.

The project will start with finding and utilising a voice to text anayliser.  

we will use other open source material to implement and start to integrate gpio commands.

the vision is for this to be used with raspberry pi zero w devices and produce a small
mobile puppy or dog like robot who can understand wide variety of commands. in future thus should
be user definable and provide a bridge to interface with common motor, ligt and display
HATS and adaptors.


version 0.1 aims to have voice recognition to know its name CHICA and be ready for further commands.
